# Proof of concept factory

This work in progress aims to deliver a software suite that's easy to work with.

It has the following aims:

- Platform agnostic (support for vue/react/solidjs/svelte).
- Low barrier for team contribution
  - Eslint & Prettier working out of the box, using (mostly) the same ruleset for each project
  - vscode configured properly for every developer using this
  - Linting on staged files.
  - Userfriendly CLI

## Start

Clone the repo, run `npm install && npm start`, and follow the on-screen instructions.
